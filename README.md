### To run

This uses NodeJS so you will need NodeJS installed

Install the dependencies first by running

`npm install`

Then you can run it via:

`node index.js --number=number`

e.g

`node index.js --number=100`

### Tests

Written in Jest for all return values including unexpected types

To run the tests, run `npm test` which just runs `jest` using it's default pattern matcher
